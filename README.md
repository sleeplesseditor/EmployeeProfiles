# EmployeeProfiles

This is a further experiment in using Meteor with React, as part of Stephen Grider's course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/meteor-react-tutorial). This app uses Meteor's instance of MongoDB (Meteor's autopublish feature has been removed from this project), Bootstrap and Flexbox for styling.

3) meteor

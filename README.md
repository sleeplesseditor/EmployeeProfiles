# EmployeeProfiles

This is a further experiment in using Meteor with React, as part of Stephen Grider's course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/meteor-react-tutorial). This app uses Meteor's instance of MongoDB (Meteor's autopublish feature has been removed from this project), Bootstrap and Flexbox for styling.

To get the app up and running, follow these steps:

1) cd EmployeeProfiles
2) npm install
3) meteor
